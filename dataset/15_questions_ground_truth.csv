Q1;"An Australian biotechnology company conducts a private expedition to collect marine genetic resources (MGRs) in areas beyond national jurisdiction (ABNJ). The collected materials are sequenced in-house, and the resulting digital sequence information (DSI) is published in open-access repositories. The same company later relies on this DSI to develop a commercially valuable enzyme. No prior informed consent (PIC) or mutually agreed terms (MAT) were established, and no monetary or non-monetary benefit-sharing has occurred. The company argues that because the material was collected in ABNJ and only DSI is being used, rather than the physical samples, no benefit-sharing obligations apply under current international law. The competent authority of Australia has not taken regulatory steps to monitor or require disclosure of the activity. Question: Identify substantive provisions that allocate legal positions to the user company in relation to the access, publication, and commercial utilisation of DSI derived from MGRs collected in ABNJ, including obligations concerning benefit-sharing.";"["BBNJ_M020", "BBNJ_M035","BBNJ_M045","BBNJ_M046", "BBNJ_M043", "BBNJ_M044", "BBNJ_M047", "BBNJ_M049", "BBNJ_M136"]"
Q2;A university-affiliated researcher from Brazil applies for access to marine genetic resources (MGRs) located within the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) of Argentina. Both Brazil and Argentina are Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) and the Nagoya Protocol. The species in question are found in an area inhabited by an Indigenous community with longstanding custodianship of the surrounding marine environment and traditional knowledge (TK) associated with the biological properties of the target organisms. The university-affiliated researcher secures an access permit from Argentina’s national competent authority, which authorises sample collection for academic purposes. However, the researcher does not engage with the Indigenous community, nor does the permit process include consultation or prior informed consent (PIC) from the TK holders. No mutually agreed terms (MAT) are established, and no arrangements are made for benefit-sharing with the community. The research proceeds, and samples are exported to Brazil for analysis. Question: Identify substantive provisions that establish whether access to MGRs and associated TK within national jurisdiction requires engagement with Indigenous Peoples and Local Communities;"["CBD_M019","NAGOYA_M008","NAGOYA_M013","NAGOYA_M014","NAGOYA_M016","NAGOYA_M026","NAGOYA_M048"]"
Q3;A publicly funded research institution based in Peru initiates a project involving the development of bioactive compounds derived from marine genetic resources (MGRs) located within Brazil’s national jurisdiction. The Peruvian researchers rely on traditional knowledge (TK) obtained from an Indigenous community in Brazil, whose members provided ethnobiological information that guided the selection of marine species and the methodology for compound extraction. The project is formally classified as non-commercial research, and access is authorised by Brazil’s national competent authority under that designation. Accordingly, mutually agreed terms (MAT) are limited to standard reporting obligations, and no benefit-sharing mechanisms are triggered at the point of access. Several years later, the compounds developed under the project attracted substantial interest from a Peruvian pharmaceutical company, which began developing and patenting commercial products based on the initial research. Since the project was never required to track downstream uses or disclose transitions from non-commercial to commercial applications, the Indigenous community receives no benefits and remains unaware of the commercialisation pathway. Question: Identify substantive provisions  that govern obligations to share benefits arising from downstream commercial use of MGRs and associated TK, including whether a non-commercial classification at the point of access limits or extinguishes benefit-sharing duties under the Nagoya Protocol.;"["NAGOYA_M003", "NAGOYA_M006", "NAGOYA_M011", "NAGOYA_M013", "NAGOYA_M015", "NAGOYA_M016", "NAGOYA_M019", "NAGOYA_M045","NAGOYA_M046","NAGOYA_M047", "NAGOYA_M048", "NAGOYA_M051", "NAGOYA_M052", "NAGOYA_M053", "NAGOYA_M054", "NAGOYA_M055", NAGOYA_M056"]"
Q4;A multinational research consortium involving institutions from Portugal, Cape Verde, and Brazil undertakes a marine sampling expedition to collect genetic resources from two distinct zones: first, from within the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) of India, and second, from an adjacent area located beyond national jurisdiction (ABNJ). The researchers do not formalise any access agreements with Indian authorities but base their sampling design and species selection on traditional knowledge (TK) informally provided by a coastal Indigenous community in India. The expedition results in a large volume of digital sequence information (DSI), which is later deposited in open-access repositories. A private biotechnology company based in Belgium, unaffiliated with the consortium, accesses the DSI and uses it to synthesise a compound that becomes the active ingredient in a commercially successful cosmetic product. The commercial viability of the compound depends on the combination of genetic traits found in samples from both zones, as well as on the TK that initially guided the identification of promising species. No prior informed consent (PIC) was obtained from the Indigenous community, and no benefit-sharing, neither monetary nor non-monetary, was arranged with either the community or the Indian national competent authority. Question: Identify substantive provisions that establish obligations to share benefits from utilisation of marine genetic resources and associated traditional knowledge collected across EEZ and ABNJ boundaries, including provisions applicable to the publication and commercial use of DSI under the CBD, the Nagoya Protocol, and the BBNJ Agreement.;"["NAGOYA_M003", "NAGOYA_M004", "NAGOYA_M006", "NAGOYA_M008","NAGOYA_M011", "NAGOYA_M013", "NAGOYA_M014", "NAGOYA_M015", "NAGOYA_M016", "NAGOYA_M026", "NAGOYA_M045", "NAGOYA_M046", "NAGOYA_M047", "NAGOYA_M048", "NAGOYA_M051", "NAGOYA_M052", "NAGOYA_M053", "NAGOYA_M054", "NAGOYA_M055", "NAGOYA_M056", "CBD_M019", "CBD_M044", "CBD_M046", "CBD_M047", "CBD_M049", "BBNJ_M021", "BBNJ_M022", "BBNJ_M023", "BBNJ_M024", "BBNJ_M025", "BBNJ_M026", "BBNJ_M027", "BBNJ_M028", "BBNJ_M029", "BBNJ_M030", "BBNJ_M031","BBNJ_M032","BBNJ_M033", "BBNJ_M035", "BBNJ_M037", "BBNJ_M038", "BBNJ_M039", "BBNJ_M040", "BBNJ_M043", "BBNJ_M044", "BBNJ_M045", "BBNJ_M046", "BBNJ_M047", "BBNJ_M049", "BBNJ_M050"]"
Q5;A regional oceanographic institute based in Indonesia enters into a public-private partnership with a biotechnology start-up from South Africa to collect marine genetic resources (MGRs) of areas beyond national jurisdiction. The samples are stored in Indonesia and later transferred to South Africa for processing and sequencing. The resulting digital sequence information (DSI) is deposited in a proprietary database managed by the private Indonesian partner. A commercial product is eventually developed using inputs. No prior informed consent (PIC) was obtained from any Indigenous Peoples and Local Communities (IPLCs), and no benefit-sharing measures were agreed upon. The Indonesian State remains unaware of the downstream commercialisation. Question: Identify substantive provisions that allocate obligations to users and States when MGRs are collected in ABNJ, transferred between jurisdictions, and later used in commercial applications involving DSI.;"["BBNJ_M021", "BBNJ_M032", "BBNJ_M035", "BBNJ_M037", "BBNJ_M038", "BBNJ_M039", "BBNJ_M040", "BBNJ_M043", "BBNJ_M044", "BBNJ_M045", "BBNJ_M046", "BBNJ_M047", "BBNJ_M049", "BBNJ_M050"]"
Q6;A university in Sri Lanka conducts joint research with a Malaysian counterpart under a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) that frames the activity as non-commercial. The project accesses marine genetic resources (MGRs) from Sri Lanka’s territorial sea and generates digital sequence information (DSI) stored in a shared repository. Years later, a private Malaysian pharmaceutical company builds upon the DSI to develop a patented molecule. Since the original access was classified as non-commercial, no mutually agreed terms (MAT) or tracking measures were put in place. The Sri Lankan authorities and associated community actors are not informed. Question: Identify substantive provisions that define the legal responsibilities of research institutions and States in ensuring benefit-sharing when DSI arising from publicly funded research is later used commercially.;"["NAGOYA_M003", "NAGOYA_M011", "NAGOYA_M013", "NAGOYA_M015", "NAGOYA_M019", "NAGOYA_M045", "NAGOYA_M046", "NAGOYA_M047", "NAGOYA_M051", "NAGOYA_M052", "NAGOYA_M053", "NAGOYA_M054", "NAGOYA_M055", "NAGOYA_M056"]"
Q7;A marine research centre in Mozambique issues a permit to a domestic university to collect marine genetic resources (MGRs) in its EEZ. The researchers rely on traditional knowledge previously gathered from coastal communities in Madagascar, without disclosing this information during the permit application. No prior informed consent (PIC) was obtained from the Malagasy communities, and no benefit-sharing provisions are included in the national access authorisation. The resulting bioactive compounds are later used in collaborative research with a French institution. Question: Identify substantive provisions that establish obligations for States and users concerning the use of TK originating in another jurisdiction, when incorporated into activities authorised under national ABS frameworks.                                     ;"["NAGOYA_M016", "NAGOYA_M026", "NAGOYA_M045", "NAGOYA_M048", "NAGOYA_M046", "NAGOYA_M047", "NAGOYA_M051", "NAGOYA_M052", "NAGOYA_M053", "NAGOYA_M013", "NAGOYA_M014", "CBD_M019"]"
Q8;An open-access repository maintained by a government-funded project in the Philippines publishes DSI generated from MGRs collected in the country’s EEZ. A private company based in Nigeria accesses the DSI and uses it to develop a novel biofertiliser for commercial use. The original research did not include downstream tracking, and no benefit-sharing was envisaged. The Philippine State becomes aware of the product only after commercialisation has already begun. Question: Identify substantive provisions that regulate benefit-sharing in scenarios where DSI published by a public institution is later used by private foreign users, especially in the absence of access conditions or notification requirements.                                                                                                    ;"["NAGOYA_M003", "NAGOYA_M013", "NAGOYA_M015", "NAGOYA_M019", "NAGOYA_M045", "NAGOYA_M046", "NAGOYA_M047", "NAGOYA_M051", "NAGOYA_M052", "NAGOYA_M053", "NAGOYA_M054", "NAGOYA_M055", "NAGOYA_M056", "CBD_M049"]"
Q9;A regional research programme involving Cuba, Ghana, and Venezuela aims to document and catalogue marine biodiversity hotspots across their respective EEZs. While Cuba and Ghana require prior informed consent (PIC) and mutually agreed terms (MAT) for access to marine genetic resources, Venezuela does not. Samples collected in Venezuelan waters are processed in Ghana and sequenced in Cuba. A regional database is created, but no harmonised approach to benefit-sharing is adopted. Question: Identify substantive provisions (duty, claim-right, power, liability, immunity) applicable to regional cooperation projects involving MGR access under variable national ABS frameworks, particularly where DSI and biological materials are exchanged across jurisdictions.;"["NAGOYA_M003", "NAGOYA_M011", "NAGOYA_M013", "NAGOYA_M015", "NAGOYA_M045", "NAGOYA_M046", "NAGOYA_M047", "NAGOYA_M051", "NAGOYA_M052", "NAGOYA_M053", "NAGOYA_M054", "NAGOYA_M055", "NAGOYA_M056", "CBD_M044", "CBD_M046", "CBD_M047", "CBD_M049"]"
Q10;Kenya and Tanzania sign a bilateral cooperation agreement allowing joint research on marine genetic resources (MGRs) in their EEZs. Under the agreement, MGR samples collected in Tanzania are transferred to Kenya for sequencing and archived in a national biobank. Years later, a Kenyan start-up uses those materials to develop a high-performance industrial enzyme, with no notification to Tanzanian authorities or benefit-sharing mechanism. Question: Identify substantive provisions that govern the downstream commercial use of MGRs transferred between Parties under bilateral cooperation frameworks, including implications for benefit-sharing and traceability.;"["NAGOYA_M003", "NAGOYA_M013", "NAGOYA_M015", "NAGOYA_M045", "NAGOYA_M046", "NAGOYA_M047", "NAGOYA_M051", "NAGOYA_M052", "NAGOYA_M053", "NAGOYA_M054", "NAGOYA_M055", "NAGOYA_M056", "CBD_M044", "CBD_M046", "CBD_M047", "CBD_M049"]"
Q11;A Vietnamese research team collects marine genetic resources in its EEZ and uses traditional knowledge from a coastal ethnic minority to target specific organisms. The researchers publish DSI based on the collected material and acknowledge institutional affiliations but make no reference to the community that contributed the knowledge. No PIC is obtained, and no benefits are returned to the knowledge holders. Years later, the DSI becomes foundational in a regional bioeconomy initiative. The community remains unrecognised. Question: Identify substantive provisions  that establish responsibilities for acknowledging TK contributions and sharing benefits when DSI and downstream innovations result from undocumented community knowledge.;"["NAGOYA_M006", "NAGOYA_M013", "NAGOYA_M014", "NAGOYA_M016", "NAGOYA_M026", "NAGOYA_M045", "NAGOYA_M046", "NAGOYA_M047", "NAGOYA_M048", "NAGOYA_M051", "NAGOYA_M052", "NAGOYA_M053", "CBD_M049", "CBD_M019"]"
Q12;An Indian marine biology institute collects MGRs in its EEZ and submits samples to a regional repository in the Seychelles for long-term storage. Without the Indian authority’s knowledge, a Colombian research centre later accesses the samples under the repository’s terms and develops a commercially viable marine antioxidant. The repository requires minimal documentation and enforces no benefit-sharing obligations. India’s ABS authorities become aware only post-commercialisation. Question: Identify substantive provisions that regulate the responsibility of States and third-party repositories for ensuring benefit-sharing when MGRs from national jurisdiction are shared beyond their control.;"["NAGOYA_M003", "NAGOYA_M013", "NAGOYA_M015", "NAGOYA_M045", "NAGOYA_M046", "NAGOYA_M047", "NAGOYA_M051", "NAGOYA_M052", "NAGOYA_M053", "NAGOYA_M054", "NAGOYA_M055", "NAGOYA_M056", "CBD_M044", "CBD_M046", "CBD_M047", "CBD_M049"]"
Q13;During an international marine science symposium held in Colombia, a community representative from Papua New Guinea informally shares traditional knowledge regarding certain marine species. A research team from Brazil later collects MGRs in ABNJ consistent with the TK and publishes the resulting DSI. A Brazilian cosmetics company commercialises one of the compounds. No PIC or MAT were ever established, and the original knowledge-sharing context was not recorded. Question: Identify substantive provisions  that apply when TK is disclosed in informal international settings and subsequently used to guide MGR collection and DSI-based innovation, particularly in ABNJ.;"["NAGOYA_M016", "NAGOYA_M026", "NAGOYA_M006", "NAGOYA_M014", "NAGOYA_M045", "NAGOYA_M046", "NAGOYA_M047", "NAGOYA_M048", "NAGOYA_M051", "NAGOYA_M052", "NAGOYA_M053", "CBD_M019", "BBNJ_M021", "BBNJ_M032", "BBNJ_M035", "BBNJ_M037", "BBNJ_M038", "BBNJ_M039", "BBNJ_M040", "BBNJ_M043", "BBNJ_M044", "BBNJ_M045", "BBNJ_M046", "BBNJ_M047"]"
Q14;A marine research consortium in Senegal obtains access permits to sample MGRs from multiple West African EEZs (The Gambia, Guinea-Bissau, and Sierra Leone). However, each national permit is granted independently, and no regional coordination exists to track duplicated collections, sample overlaps, or shared benefit-sharing obligations. Some species are sampled multiple times under different permits, and the DSI generated is pooled into a single research platform. Question: Identify substantive provisions that address duplicative access to MGRs across multiple national permits, including obligations for States and users to ensure benefit-sharing and transparency in cross-border collection scenarios.;"["NAGOYA_M003", "NAGOYA_M013", "NAGOYA_M015", "NAGOYA_M045", "NAGOYA_M046", "NAGOYA_M047", "NAGOYA_M051", "NAGOYA_M052", "NAGOYA_M053", "CBD_M044", "CBD_M046", "CBD_M047", "CBD_M049"]"
Q15;A private marine biotech company in India funds a university research project focused on sequencing MGRs from India’s EEZ. The university signs access agreements under its non-commercial status and omits mention of its private partner. After sequencing, the company claims the DSI for product development. The national ABS authority had no knowledge of the private funder, and no MAT or benefit-sharing terms were negotiated for commercial use. This raises concerns over misrepresentation of research intent and hidden industry-academic collaboration. Question: Identify substantive provisions that govern the disclosure of user identity and intent in access agreements involving MGRs, particularly when institutional users are acting on behalf of undisclosed commercial partners.;"["NAGOYA_M003", "NAGOYA_M013", "NAGOYA_M015", "NAGOYA_M019", "NAGOYA_M045", "NAGOYA_M046", "NAGOYA_M047", "NAGOYA_M051", "NAGOYA_M052", "NAGOYA_M053", "NAGOYA_M054", "NAGOYA_M055", "NAGOYA_M056", "CBD_M044", "CBD_M046", "CBD_M047", "CBD_M049"]"
