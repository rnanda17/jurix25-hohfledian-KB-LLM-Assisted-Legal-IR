      "Question: A publicly funded research institution based in Peru initiates a project involving the development of bioactive compounds derived from marine genetic resources (MGRs) located within Brazil’s national jurisdiction. The Peruvian researchers rely on traditional knowledge (TK) obtained from an Indigenous community in Brazil, whose members provided ethnobiological information that guided the selection of marine species and the methodology for compound extraction. The project is formally classified as non-commercial research, and access is authorised by Brazil’s national competent authority under that designation. Accordingly, mutually agreed terms (MAT) are limited to standard reporting obligations, and no benefit-sharing mechanisms are triggered at the point of access. Several years later, the compounds developed under the project attracted substantial interest from a Peruvian pharmaceutical company, which began developing and patenting commercial products based on the initial research. Since the project was never required to track downstream uses or disclose transitions from non-commercial to commercial applications, the Indigenous community receives no benefits and remains unaware of the commercialisation pathway. Question: Identify substantive provisions  that govern obligations to share benefits arising from downstream commercial use of MGRs and associated TK, including whether a non-commercial classification at the point of access limits or extinguishes benefit-sharing duties under the Nagoya Protocol.\n",

      "Question: A multinational research consortium involving institutions from Portugal, Cape Verde, and Brazil undertakes a marine sampling expedition to collect genetic resources from two distinct zones: first, from within the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) of India, and second, from an adjacent area located beyond national jurisdiction (ABNJ). The researchers do not formalise any access agreements with Indian authorities but base their sampling design and species selection on traditional knowledge (TK) informally provided by a coastal Indigenous community in India. The expedition results in a large volume of digital sequence information (DSI), which is later deposited in open-access repositories. A private biotechnology company based in Belgium, unaffiliated with the consortium, accesses the DSI and uses it to synthesise a compound that becomes the active ingredient in a commercially successful cosmetic product. The commercial viability of the compound depends on the combination of genetic traits found in samples from both zones, as well as on the TK that initially guided the identification of promising species. No prior informed consent (PIC) was obtained from the Indigenous community, and no benefit-sharing, neither monetary nor non-monetary, was arranged with either the community or the Indian national competent authority.

    "  – If both zones are implicated, include both sets where each zone’s obligations are triggered.\n",
    "• Allocative filter (hard): keep rows that impose or allocate concrete legal positions to identified actors (e.g., “shall/must/required to/entitled to/liable to”) for the relevant lifecycle facet. Drop rows that are purely objectives, principles, scope/definitions, general cooperation/capacity/technology-transfer, finance, or institution-building unless they impose a concrete obligation tied to the specific fact pattern.\n",
    "• Specificity preference: prefer rows that explicitly match (i) the exact jurisdictional setting (national vs ABNJ), (ii) resource/data type (MGR/GR/derivatives/DSI), (iii) TK involvement, and (iv) the lifecycle facet(s) implicated. \n",
